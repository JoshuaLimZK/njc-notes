# Market Failure

>[!info] Definition
> The free market fails to allocate resources in an efficient manner → Allocative efficiency is not achieved

# Role of the government

- Efficiency — efficient allocation and utilisation of resources
- Equity — fair distribution of welfare in society

# Causes of Market Failure

## Public Goods
Public Goods are:
- Non-excludable in consumption
	- Not economically posisble to omit someone from consuming it once it is produced
	- No rational consumer will want to pay for the service
	- Leads to free rider problem
- Non-rivalrous in consumption
	- Consumption of the good by one person does not reduce the benefit of the good available to others
	- Marginal cost of additional user is zero
	- Since P = MC, producers have to charge $0
	- No private firms are willing to provide the service
- Non-rejectable
	- Individual is unable to choose to forego consumption or prevent themselves from benefitting from the good.
	- e.g. Nuclear defence programme

**Government Intervention**
Government will provide the public good
They need to do cost benefit analysis to determine how much to produce

## Externalities

Private individuals and firms only consider their own private costs and benefits to maximise their own satisfaction. 
They do not take into account the external cost and benefits that are imposed on society

### Positive Externalities
- External benefits gained by the society from the consumption or production of a good or service by private individuals or firms respectively
- In consumption
	- e.g. Herd Immunity
- In production
	- E.g. R&D from other companies

### Negative Externalities
- External cost imposed on society from the consumption or production of a good or service by private individuals or firms respectively.
- In consumption
	- e.g. Second-hand smokers
- In production
	- e.g. Pollution by producer

MSB = MPB + MEB
MSC = MPC + MEC

Allocative efficiency occurs when MSB = MSC

**Government Intervention**
- **Market-based solutions**
	- Taxation
		- Shifts MPC curve to MPC + Tax
		- Production will then occur at a socially optimal level where MSB = MSC
		- Benefit
			- Internalisation of external costs
			- Generates Tax revenue
		- Disadvantage
			- Government has imperfect info
			- Administrative Cost
	- Quota/Ban
		- Set level of consumption or production of an activity to the socially optimal level
		- Benefits
			- High level of certainty in terms of outcome
			- Appropriate for dire and urgent situations
		- Disadvantages
			- Enforcement costs
	- Tradable Permits
		-  Advantages
			- There is a component of quota, the quantity can be definitively determined with certainty
			- Incentive for firms to reduce external costs
		- Disadvantages
			- If the cost to reduce pollution (abatement cost) is extremely high, then firms will rather pay for the permit from other firms → no incentive to reduce pollution (Assuming the price of permit is lower than abatement cost)
			- Government needs to decide how to allocate the permits
			- Enforcement issues
			- Dominant firms buying up permits and refuse to trade
- **Non-Market-based solutions**
	- Legislation/Government Regulation
		- Prohibit or limit behaviour that creates external costs
		- Threat of legal action against firms
		- Advantages:
			- Easy to implement
			- Simple to understand
		- Disadvantages
			- Difficult and expensive to enforce
			- Penalties must be sufficiently harsh
			- Government must accurately estimate the impact of the legislation in order to achieve the socially optimal level consumption/production
	- Education/campaign advertisements
		- Provides information on external costs to discourage consumption/production
		- Advantages
			- Reduces ignorance (information failure)
			- Takes time and effects are uncertain
			- Not feasible in the short run

## Information Failure

### Imperfect Information on costs and benefits

### Asymmetric information
- Adverse Selection
	- Before transaction
	- Market adversely selects against higher quality goods in favour of lower quality ones
	- Market will fail as buyers will not want to buy the good
	- e.g. used car market, insurance
- Moral Hazard
	- After transaction
	- Since one party doesn't have full info, there is incentive for party with more info to behave sub-optimally
	- Party without full info will decide not to be in the market
	- e.g. fire insurance

**Government Intervention**
- Public Education
	- Advantages:
		- Less distortions to price signals
		- Addresses the root cause of information failure
	- Disadvantages:
		- Difficult to influence mindsets and habits (long term policy)
- Regulation
	- E.g. bans on illicit drugs, partial bans on smoking
	- Advantages:
		- Easy to implement
		- Easy to understand
	- Disadvantages
		- Admin and enforcement costs
		- over correction

## Market Dominance

Firms with market power are incentivised to restrict output and raise prices above marginal costs.

Restrict output → Underproduction (produce less than the optimal quantity)
Raise price above MC → Allocative inefficiency

**Government Intervention**
- Anti-trust policies
- Lump sum taxes
- Nationalisation
- Pricing policies (AC/MC Pricing)

## Factor Immobility

Inability or unwillingness of a resource to shift from one use or area to another.

### Occupational Immobility
Barriers to the mobility of factors of production between different industries and occupations

Reasons include lack of relevant skills and not knowing which are the growing industries

e.g labour retrenched in the textile industry may not have the necessary skills to work in other expanding industries

### Geographical Immobility
Lack of preparedness of people to move between and within countries in response to changes in the labour market either due to social or financial factors.

Reasons include social: separation from family or culture, or financial factors

Factor immobility prevents the switch of resources to the production of new goods and services most valued by society (due to changing demand) → Allocative Inefficiency

Due to factor immobility, resources will be unemployed. So economy is producing within in the PPC → Productive inefficiency

**Government Intervention**
- Improve Information Flow
	- Provide information on jobs to those looking for work and connect firms with possible suitable labour
- Training of workers → Up-skilling

Factor Immobility leads to inequity as lower-educated/unskilled workers tend to face occupational immobility due to a lack of qualifications.

# Cognitive Biases

## Sunk Cost Fallacy

- Person's decision is affted by the sunk cost rather than marginal costs
- Economic agents bhoose to do something even when the MC > MB because they take into consideration the suck cost, which they should not.

## Loss Aversion

- Tendency for people to prefer avoiding a loss over making an equivalent or greater gain
- i.e. people value loss over gain of the same value

## Salience Bias

- Tendency for people to focus on information that is more prominent and over other less prominent but equally relevant pieces of information.

# Government Failure

- Imperfect information
- Bureaucracy, time lags and inefficiency
- Lack of market incentives
- Shifts in government policies creating market uncertainties
- Myopic decision-making
- Pursuit of self-interest
