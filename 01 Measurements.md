# 01 Measurements

# Base Units

| Base Quantity     | Unit          |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Mass              | kilogram - kg |
| Length            | metre - m     |
| Time              | second - s    |
| Current           | ampere - A    |
| Temperature       | kelvin - K    |
| Amt. of substance | mole - mol    | 

# Derived Units

Expressed in terms of base unit by using its defined equation

# Homogeneity of Physical Equations
- Only terms with the same units can be added or subtracted
- Units on both sides must be the same
- The exponent of a term should not have any units

**Note:** A homogeneous equation need not be correct

How to present answers
> Show that $s = ut + \frac{1}{2} at ^2$ is a homogeneous equation.

> Units of $ut$ = $(ms^{-1})(s)$ = $m$
> Units of $\frac{1}{2}at^2$ = $(ms^{-2})(s^2)$ = $m$
> Units of $s$ = $m$
> Since units of $ut$ = units of $\frac{1}{2} a t^2$ = units of $s$ = $m$, the equation is homogeneous.

# Scalar vs Vector Quantities

**Scalar Quantities** can only be represented by magnitude
**Vector Quantities** posses a magnitude and direction in space

| Scalar      | Vector        |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Distance    | Displacement  |
| Speed       | Velocity      |
| Temperature | Acceleration  |
| Energy      | Force         |
| Power       | Momentum      |
| Mass        | Weight        |
| Density     | Moment/Torque | 

# Arithmetic involving vectors

Methods:
- Geometry, Sine/Cosine Rule
	- $c^2 = \sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }$
	- $\frac{{\sin A}}{a} = \frac{{\sin B}}{b} = \frac{{\sin C}}{c}$
	- $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$
- Resolving Vectors into Vertical/Horizontal Components

# Errors

## Systematic Errors
- Causes reading to consistently more/less than actual value
- Can use different environment or technique to detect
- Can be eliminated if the cause is known and rectified

## Random Errors
- Causes a scatter of reading about a mean value
- Cannot be eliminated but can be minimised by taking average

# Precision and Accuracy

**Accuracy** is how close a measurement or result is to the true value.
**Precision** is a measure of how small the spread of repeated readings or results are.

# Uncertainty

**Fractional uncertainty** is $\frac{\Delta d}{d_{average}}$
**Percentage uncertainty** is $\frac{\Delta d}{d_{average}} \times 100 \%$

For addition & subtraction, just add the uncertainties
For pure multiplication, division or exponentials:
$$
Z = k \left( \frac{{A^n \cdot B^m}}{C^p} \right)
$$
$$
\frac{\Delta Z}{Z} = \ \mid n \mid \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right) + \mid m \mid \left( \frac{\Delta B}{B} \right) + \mid p \mid \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)
$$

**Uncertainty Convention for A Levels**
1. Abs uncertainty rounded to 1 s.f.
2. Value & Abs uncertainty same units
3. Calculated value rounded to the same place as abs uncertainty
