**National Income** - Income generated from the production of all final goods and services by a country within a specific period, normally a year.
- Often used as a measure of the overall level of economic activity in a country.

National Income = $C^d + I + G + (x - m)$

# Standard of Living

Level of economic welfare and social well-being of an individual or household

Material SOL → Quantity of goods and services that individuals have avaliable for consumption
Non-Material SOL → Qualitative aspects of life

Higher NY → Higher income generated from the productions of all final goods and services (definition)→ Households would have higher purchasing power and have greated ability to access and purchase goods and services available for consumption → Higher matiral SOL thus higher SOL if non-material remains the same.

$\therefore$ Real GNI is a better indicator of SOL because it takes into account changes in the price level (e.g. due to inflation)
