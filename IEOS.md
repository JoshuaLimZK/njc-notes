# Internal Economies of Scale

Firm's own scale of production increases regardless of the size of the industry

**Plant**
- **Specialisation and Division of Labour**
	- Breakdown of complex manufacturing production process into simpler specialise steps
	- Workers can be allocated to their most efficient specialised stages
	- Workers can produce with more speed and dexterity, less time lost from task switching
	- Training cost reduced as workers only need to be specialised in one job
- **Use of highly efficient indivisible machineries**
	- Larger firms can utilise their machinery more efficiently e.g. working on 24 hr shift
	- The percentage increase in cost for using the machinery more is less than the percentage increase in output due to high productivity of the machines

**Firm**
- Marketing Economies
	- Firms need to purchase more factor inputs → Therefore more bargaining power through bulk purchases discount
	- Lower per-unit distribution costs
- Financial Economies
	- Larger firms accumulate and have more assets → Offered as collateral for cheaper loans / smaller interest rate
	- Large firms can Issue more shares
- Organisational Economies
	- Centralised administration → Reduce duplicate administrative tasks
- Managerial Economies
		- More specialised departments for administration → better management
		- More output processed using same amount or less manpower
- Risk-Bearing Economies
	- Diversify risk, especially if firm operates in multiple markets

**Analysis:**
Increase in firms costs of production due to larger scale in production is spread across an even larger level of output. Since total avg cost = total cost / level of output

Long run average cost lowered from c1 to c2
illustrated by movement from A to B along LRAC
when firm's output is increased from Q1 to Q2
