# Market Failure

**Ideally**
Free Market System → Efficient Allocation of Resources

Under certain conditions, free market can achieve [[allocative efficiency]]

Demand for a good increase → Pressure for the price to increase → incentive for producers to transfer resources. → Price increase to (P = MC or DD = SS)

Key characteristic of the free market: Self-interest
In principle, free market system can achieve socially optimal outcome

**Reality**
Under certain conditions, free market does not achieve [[allocative efficiency]]
This is why the market fails

>[!note] Market failure
>occurs when the free market fails to allocate resources in an efficient manner (ie. [[allocative efficiency]] is not achieved)

$\therefore$ there is a role for the government to play in the market.

Microeconomic aims of the government:
- Efficiency - efficient allocation and utilisation of resources
- Equity - fair distribution of welfare in society

# Sources of Market Failure

- Public Goods
- Externalities: Positive and negative
- Information Failure
	- Imperfect information on costs and benefits
	- Aymmetric information
	- Market dominance
	- Factor immobility

# Public Goods

Public good characteristics:
- ![[Non-excludability in consumption]]
- ![[Non-rivalry in consumption]]

>[!note] Free Rider Problem
>Free-rider problem is a situation in which an individual is able to enjoy benefits from the consumption of a good or service without having to pay for the consumption of the good or service.

There will be no provision of public goods if left to the free market

**Government's Decision Making**
Cost < Benefit
Cost → Monetary costs, opportunity costs, unintended consequences
Benefits → Present and Future

Evaluation of government provision of public good
- Without price mechnism, government may not know the costs and benefits and end up providing more than it should

Third Characteristic of public good → Non-rejectability

individuals are unable to choose to forego consumption of prevent themselves from benefitting from the good once it is provided.
