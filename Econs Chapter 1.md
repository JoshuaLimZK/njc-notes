# 1 Scarcity, Choice and Opportunity Cost

## 1.1.1 Resources

**Resources / Factors of Production**
- **Land**
	- Productive resources supplied by nature
- **Labour**
	- Human effort directed toward production of good
- **Capital**
	- Man-made resource used in the further production of another good
- **Entrepreneurship**
	- Managerial Ability via organising resources

## 1.1.2 Positive & Normative Econs

- **Normative**
	- Objective
- **Positive**
	- Subjective

## 1.2 Scarcity, Choice and Resource Allocation

**Scarcity** → Human wants are unlimited but resources available to satisfy those wants are limited

To maximise consumer satisfaction → 3 questions:
- What & How much to produce
- How to produce
- For Whom to produce

> [!info] Definition
> **Opportunity Cost** is the value of the *next best* alternative forgone when a choice is made.

# 2 Rational Decision Making

## 2.1.2 Marginalist Principle

Rational decision making involves weighing marginal benefit against marginal cost

> [!info] Definition
> **Marginal Benefit** refers to the additional benefit gained from consuming or producing one more unit of the good

> [!info] Definition
> **Marginal Cost** refers to the additional cost incurred from consuming or producing one more unit of the good

**Market equilibrium** in achieved when **Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost**

**Self Interest Maximising behaviour of economic agents**
- **Consumers**
	- Only considers private costs and benefits
	- Therefore will consume where MPC = MPB
- **Workers**
	- Maximise Income
- **Firms**
	- Maximise Profits
	- Where MR = MC
- **Government**
	- Maximise Social Welfare

## 2.2 Concepts of Efficiency

To maximise level of satisfaction → efficiency must be attained

> [!info] Definition
> **Productive Efficiency** is achieved when firms in an economy are producing the maximum output for the given amount of inputs,
> **or** 
> producing a given output with the least cost combination of inputs

>[!info] Definition
> **Allocative Efficiency** is achieved when the current combination of goods and services produced and consumed allows the society to attain the greatest level of satisfaction

Allocative efficiency condition → Price offered for the last unit of good = marginal cost for its production (P=MC)

## 2.3 Production Possibility Curve

> [!info] Definition
> **PPC** shows the maximum attainable combination of 2 goods and services that can be produced in an economy, where all available resources are used fully and efficiently, at a given state of technology

Assumptions:
- Economy only produces 2 goods
- Production is observed over a specific time period
- Quality & Quantity of Goods are constant
- Resources are fully employed and efficiently utilised
- There is no change in the level of technology

## 2.3.1 Concepts Illustrated by the PPC

- **Scarcity** → There are unattainable combinations outside the PPC
- **Constraint** → The economy can only produce within or on the PPC
- **Choice** → Society can only choose 1 point to produce at
- **Opportunity Cost** → PPC is has negative gradient
- **Productive Efficiency** → Every point along the PPC is productive efficient
- **Unemployment and Underemployment** → Points inside the PPC are inefficient as resources are either unemployed or underemployed
- **Allocative Efficiency** → Singular Point along the PPC Where Satisfaction is maximum
- **2.3.2 Increasing Opportunity Cost** → Curve is concave to origin
	- As the economy concentrates on the production of one good, it has to start using resources that are less suitable — and more suited to the other good

## 2.3.3 Economic Growth and Shifts of the PPC

**Actual economic growth**
- Short-run growth
- Illustrated by outward movement of point within PPC closer to on on the PPC

**Potential economic growth**
- Long-run growth
- Illustrated by the shift of the PPC curve outward
- Sources:
	- **Increases in the Qty and Quality of Resources**
		- Can result in skewed or parallel shift of PPC depending on whether resource is more suited to one good
	- **Technological Improvements**
		- Can result in skewed or parallel shift of PPC depending on whether technology is more suited to one good
