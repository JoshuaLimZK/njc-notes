> 1. How is the sport participant viewed as an actor (line 2)? Use your own words as far as possible.

While playing sports, sportsmen take on a different persona.

*We are different from our usual selves. We form our own context, take on novel personas and weave wonderful imaginary tales.*

**CANNOT USE WORD 2 WORDS UP AND DOWN FROM LINE.**

> 2. According to the author, other than providing income (line 10), how do spectators influence sport? Use your own words as far as possible.

Spectators provide an atmosphere, analysis on player performance and contribute to the feeling and turn of events of the sport.

*Spectators serve as the rousing collective voice, providing cheers and applause adding to the atmosphere. They talk about the game and effectively determine the direction of the sport.*

> 3. Explain the apparent contradiction in taking sport seriously (line 17). Use your own words as far as possible.

Even though the rules of sports have been clearly laid out, in actuality sports is just an advanced version of play. Playing sports does not make sense when considering its benefits.

*One would expect that sport is part of a structured system, instead, it is an intricate version of entertainment.*

> 5. Why does the author refer to sport as a “circus” (line 31)? Use your own words as far as possible.

Sport cannot be initiated instantly but requires proper infrastructure such as governing bodies, locations and players. These require capital to fund.

*It is because sport is entertainment that is striking on a large scale that requires order and a governing body, physical resources, large venues and people with spcialised skills and training. It also needs to be financially supported by sponsors.*

> 9. Explain what the author means by ‘”to hold them both at arm’s length” (line 86).

The author believes that political issues and monetary incentives should be taken less into account in the world of sport.

*It is a reference to how sport must ensure that the government and the commercial world should remain at a distance and not interfere.*

> 11. David Goldblatt makes several observations about taking sport seriously. How far would you agree with David Goldblatt’s views? Relate your opinions to you and your own society.

David Goldblatt asserts that serious, organised play in the form of spectacular sports events has to have a structured system in place. This system includes the implementation of rules, rule-making institutions, facilities and professional athletes. He also highlights the intersection between sports and politics, by stating that modern sport is political and deals with money and power. In the context of Singapore, I agree with Goldblatt's stand to a considerable extent. He accurately portrays the reality of serious organised play where it requires a well-coordinated mechanism of rules, facilities, athletes and money, which apply directly to Singapore's sports scene. In addition, his view on the political aspects of sport seems applicable, albeit not to an extreme extent, in Singapore's context where politics subtly interacts with sports. For instance, the existence of regulatory bodies, such as Singapore Sports Council, facilitates the organisation of serious, professional play in sports. This includes the stipulation of rules and guidelines that ensure fair play and safety. Additionally, in terms of facilities and professional athletes, Singapore has made substantial investments to foster a vibrant sport ecosystem. Massive sporting complexes, such as the 35-hectare Singapore Sports Hub, attest to this commitment. However, sports in Singapore, unlike in countries such as the United States, where sports and politics heavily intertwine, does not carry heavy political undertones. The government certainly plays a role in advocating for the importance of sports and providing national support for major sports events, but politics seldom intrude on the sports field. Therefore, while the production and consumption of modern sport in Singapore is political to some extent, it is with a "small p" as Goldblatt describes. To conclude, Goldblatt’s observations about serious, organised play in sports largely resonate with the situation of sports in Singapore, with less intense political involvement evident. His views accurately highlight the workings and complexities involved in maintaining the prestige and integrity of sports, backed up by real contexts in Singapore. While the economic and political factors he described are essential facets of organised play, the ultimate goal remains the fostering of sportsmanship and the love for sports among the public.
