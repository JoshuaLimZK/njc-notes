## Price Determination
### Positive Economic effects
- Firms
	- More [[profit|profits]]
- Consumer
	- Cross Subsidisation (3rd degree PD)
	- In market B now able to afford
	- Higher [[revenue]] from market A subsidises market B
- Society
	- Allows for production which is otherwise unprofitable
	- Improved Equity → Lower income can enjoy the good
### Negative Economic effects
- Loss of [[consumer surplus]] (for some groups of consumers)
- Lower equity → increased profits at the expense of some consumers
### Conditions
1. Able to set its price → have some market power and some control over the price
	- Every type of market other than [[perfect competition]]
2. Able to separate the market & prevent resale
	- usually intangible goods
	- Markets shouldn't be able to sell to each other
3. [[price elasticity of demand|Price elasticities of demand]] for separate groups of consumers must be different
	- If PEDs are the same, the price in both markets

## Non-Price competition in Imperfect Markets
- Refers to the use of various strategies to increase the demand for a firm's product
- Gain market share without changing price
### Product Differentiation
- Real product differentiation
	- R&D, [[innovation]], [[product development]], services
- Imaginary product differentiation
	- Advertising, [[branding]], packaging
	- e.g. same manufacturer but have different labels/brands
