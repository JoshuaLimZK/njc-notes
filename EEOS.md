# External Economies of Scale

Economies of concentration
- Plants near each other can share third party resources, labour pool → Lowers production costs
Economies of Information
- More supporting firms offering research services, common information for the industry → Improves production process
Economies of disintegration
- Network of auxiliary firms, e.g. subcontractors → Lowers production costs
