Synoptic Question
1. Identify the phrase which supports / undermines the idea
	→ Paraphrase
2. Justification (can be simple)

Capturing the essence of the idea is more important than the justification.

Q7: History is usually thought of as equipping us with the skills necessary to handle issues. Even through passage 1 states that history is unable to provide us with ways to deal with what is to come, Passage 3 offers the perspective that there are skills to be learnt.

Q8: History intrigues us because it captures ideas about the larger human existence that remains true regardless of the period we live in. Even though Passage 2 proposes that the need that is satisfied by history is one about the individual and their immediate relations, Passage 3 proposes that it is universal.

> 6. Using material from paragraphs 2 to 6, summarise the value and attractions of the study of history, both generally and especially in today's world.

1. *There has never been a better time, and never a more urgent need, to explore our past than exists today.*
	- 
2. *Technologies such as aerial mapping, carbon dating, thermal imaging and deep-sea submersibles afford historians far greater opportunities to recover the distant past than the crude shovels and diving bells of their predecessors.*
3. *The use of advanced technology to store, catalogue and disseminate archival evidence more efficiently is stimulating new interpretations of the history of our planet.*
4. *‘Interpreting’ the past is, in fact, the essential business of the historian, who is responding to one of the most fundamental of human instincts: the desire to discover – or indeed impose – some kind of order on the seemingly haphazard ebb and flow of happening.*
5. *Whether or not we find a satisfying explanation of the past, our study satisfies another basic need – curiosity. It is present in our desire to find out about our family and the place where we live*
6. *this shared knowledge of what our predecessors thought and did in their everyday lives is essential if we are to have a sense of common identity.*
7. *we discover that underneath superficial differences earlier generations were very like ourselves, ... given that similar causes produce similar results, it can teach us how to avoid their mistakes and inspire us to emulate their triumphs.*
8. *For the beneficial changes they brought about teach us that we do not have to put up with things as they are, and this gives us the humility to recognise that our greater knowledge does not make us any wiser than our ancestors.*
9. *We must grow into something like a single family or we will annihilate ourselves, and it is only by understanding our various 'family' histories that we can learn to live together in tolerance and mutual respect.*
