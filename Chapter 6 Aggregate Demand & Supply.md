Keynesian Theory of National Income Determination
- Nation's production, employment and income depends on the level of aggregate demand
- If demand falls → firms produce less and employ less
- Income fall → Demand does not increase
- Price and wages are "sticky" downward and may not fall
- Economy will settle into an equilibrium situation that is below full employment
- Therefore government should intervene

Circular flow of income

When expenditure equals to income earned which is all spend on the output produced, there is no change in the circular flow of income

National Output = National Income = National Expenditure

In reality households don't spend all their income,
Savings: form of withdrawal from circular flow of income
Withdrawal = Income generated from production not spent on other domestic goods and services

Firms also spend to buy capital goods,
This is investment expenditure that creates income from other firms
Injection is an addition of spending to the circular flow of income

Hence, in 2-sector economy, Y = AD = C + I

Government sector:
- Collects taxes from other sectors → form of withdrawal
- Government expenditure → injection

Hence, in 3-sector economy, Y = AD = C + I + G

International sector:
- Export revenue → Injection
- Import expenditure → Withdrawal

Hence, in 4-sector economy, Y = AD = C + I + G + (X + M)

If injections > withdrawal: Net increase in aggregate demand in the economy

% Change in Real Income = % Change in Nominal Income - % Change in Price Level

Aggregate demand is the total value of domestically-produced final goods and services demanded by households, firms, the government and foreign countries at each price level in a given time period

Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
- Proportion of any increase in naitonal income that goes into consumption
- Shows change in C as a result of a change in Y
- MPC = $\Delta$C / $\Delta$Y

Non-Income determinants of C
- Expectations of future prices and income
- Changes in interest rates/ The cost and availability of credit
- Wealth effects
- Distribution of income
- Government policy
- Lifestyles / Demographics

Govt expenditure vs transfer
expenditure → 2 ways
Transfer → Unilateral

AD = C + I + G + (X - M)

Answering Macro Questions:
1. Factor affecting AS and/or AS
2. How (direction and/or magnitude of change) the AD or AS Changes
3. Explain how changes in AD/AS affect:
	- 4 Macro aims
	- Standard of living
	- 2 Micro aims
		- Efficiency
		- Equity
