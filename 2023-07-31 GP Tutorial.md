# Paraphrasing

> "In your own words as far as possible"

- Capture exactly what the author is saying from the passage
- Don't add on information
- Consider the right synonym for that context
	- E.g. fake can be counterfeit or insincere
- Capture the intensity (with modifiers)
- Check your grammar (paraphrasing the <u>idea</u>, NOT word for word)
