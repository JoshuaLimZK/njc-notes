# Information Failure

Adverse Selection:
Before transaction

Moral Hazard:
After transaction

## Asymmetric Information
**One party** in the market **has more information than the other*** resulting in a distortion of incentives and **inefficient market outcomes**

## Adverse Selection

Asymmetric info b/w buyers and sellers cause one of the parties to make suboptimal choices → lower welfare → thus an inefficient market outcome

### Solutions
- Investing in information (self)
- Signalling (self) → e.g. Warranty
- Screening (self or firms) → e.g. external inspection
- Laws
	- Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) → 6 mtns replacement
	- Industry Standards
	- Health Products Bill → All health products are evaluated
	- Registration of private schools

## Moral Hazards
Economic agents take greater risks than they normally would because the resulting costs will not be borne by them, but instead the cost is shifted onto the other part.

### Solutions
- Incentives → e.g. lowering premiums for those who are careful
- Deductibles and co-payment

# Market Dominance

Government Intervention
- Anti-trust
- Lump sum taxes
- Nationalisation
- Pricing policies
