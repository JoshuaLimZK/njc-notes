Economics growth → Economy producing more goods and services. Rate of change of National Income
Sustainable growth → Grow in a sustained manner. Any environmental resource indicator
Inclusive growth → Gini Coefficient

Consequences of Economic Growth:
In theory: Economic growth increases goods to consume and increases material SOL
There are costs to economic growth → Economic growth may not be sustainable or inclusive

# Benefits of Economic Growth:
*benefits may be condititonal*
- Increase levels of consumption or leisure leading to higher material & non-material SOL.
	- Actual Economic Growth → G&S Produced increase → More G&S to consume → Increase Material SOL
	- Potential Economic Growth → Productive Capacity increase → Fewer FOP to Produce same input → More time for leisure → Increase Non-material SOL

- Fall in unemployment or inflation
	- Actual Economic Growth (AD and/or SRAS increase) → Demand for FOP increase → Unemployed FOP Employed → Unemployment decrease
	- Potential Economic Growth (LRAS increase) → Productive capacity increase → More G&S can be produced → General Price level decrease → Inflation decrease

- Enables easier redistribution of incomes, thus promotes inclusiveness:
	- Actual Economic Growth → Income level increase → Income Taxes collected increase → Ability to distribute to and/or projects for Lower income → Income inequality decrease

- Society cna afford to care more for the environment (Sustainable economic growth):
	- Actual Economic Growth → Income Level Increase → Ability to Clean up environment or use cleaner production methods increase → Sustainable growth

# Costs of Economic Growth:

- Opportunity cost of current consumption and current material SOL falls. 
	- To promote potential economic growith → Divert resources from consumer goods to capital goods → Quantity of consumer goods decrease, thus current consumption decreases → current material SOL decreases

 - Environmnetal costs and depletion of non-renewable resources
	 - Actual Economic growth → Levels of consumption & production increasae → Resources used, ⭐

- Greater income inequality
	- Actual Economic Growth → Some sectors may grow and others decline → Wages of workers in growing sectors increases → Wages of workers in declining sectors decrease → Greater Incoem Inequalitity
	- Potential Economic Growth → More goods and services produced with fewer workers → Some workers would be retrenched → Income levels of some workers decrease → Greater income inequality
	
- Unemployment increases
	- Potential economic growth →  More goods and services produced with fewer workers → Some workers would be retrenched → Unemployment increases

- Social and Personal Costs
	- Actual Economic Growth → demand for G&S increase → workers work harder → ⭐

- Leading to balance of trade deficit
	- Acutal Economic Growth → Demand for imported G&S increase → If M drastically increase such taht now M > X → BOT Deficit
