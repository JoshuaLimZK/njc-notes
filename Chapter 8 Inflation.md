Aim Income Growth > Inflation

Inflation → Increase in the overall level of prices in the economy

Inflation measured using CPI

Low inflation → 0-3%
Moderate Inflation → under 10%
Galloping Inflation → ~200%
Hyperinflation → Million %

Inflation: a sustained increase in the general price level of an economy

General Price Level → Average price of wide range of goods

1 Item increase in price ≠ inflation
Exception: Crude Oil

Increase general price level → Indication of

- Rising Costs of Living
- How the economy is performing

It is possible to lave a galling GPL → Deflation: Sustained decrease in the general price level of an economy

Near Yf → Drastic increase in price level

Cause of Cost Push Inflation
Increase in cost of prodn
Less ability to supply
decrease SRAS
GPL increase

Causes:
- Imported price push → rising cost of imports
- Increase in structural rigidities → new contract/govt policies
- Wage Push spiral → power of Trade unions
	- Higher Cost of Living (higher GPL) → ask for higher wages → firms accede → increase COP → decrease SRAS → loop back
- Profit push: Monopoly power of supplier → Can charge high COP
- Currency depreciation
- Supply Shock (SRAS/LRAS): affects availability of resources within economy
	- ![[Pasted image 20240129095452.png|300]]
	- Falling LRAS rare
Persistent increase in COP → Firms respond by passing on to consumers in the form of higher prices and by cutting back on production

Cost push more serious as NY decrease while GPL increase

High Inflation, Uncertainty of future prices as costs increase → decrease profit → decrease investment → Decrease AD → Decrease economic growth, increase unemployment

Relatively higher price of domestic goods and services → decrease price competitiveness → Assume PEDx decerase → Oty Demanded of exports by more than proportional, decrease X revenue, decrease (X-M) → Decrease economic growth, increase unemployment, decrease balance of trade

Relatively higher price of domestic g&s → increase menu costs: as firms constantly update price lists
Relatively higher price of domestic g&s → increase shoe leather costs: due to intense search for financial assets offering highest interest rate

Nominal wages increase < inflation rate → decrease real income → Decrease real PP → Decrease MSOL
Real PP Decrease → workers work OT to keep up with rising COL → more stress, less leisure → decrease NMSOL
Widens income inequality → wealthy hold assets that appreciate during inflation

Savers: If interest rate < inflation rate → Real savings decrease
Debtors: Take a loan in nominal terms to be repaid at a future date → Interest rate < inflation rate → real value of loan decrease
Creditors: Lend a sum of money in nominal terms to be repaid at a future date → Interest rate < inflation rate → real value of loan decrease

Macroeconomic Aim: Low inflation
